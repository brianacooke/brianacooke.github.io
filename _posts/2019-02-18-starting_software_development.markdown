We live in an age where we have really incorporated techonoglogy into our daily lives. Our devices have become our main tools of socializing, learning, gathering information, and in this case, even finishing an educational program. Technology progresses everyday and I want to be a part of that progress becuase I don't think it is going away anytime soon.

I went to the University of Arizona doing an online program with a major in Information Science & eSociety. We learned about the culture of the internet and I even had a class about the history of hacking and opensource culture. I was reading about programmers everyday but without knowing HOW to do it. I think this program really compliments my other programs and I am excited to learn!
